# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
I think the most difficult part for me was the percent problem just becasue the solution we found in class used pieces of code I wasn't really familiar with, even though there wre other ways to do it the methods I used sadly did not work completely, but I do nderstadn what we did in class so I think with a little bit of time I can completel these types of problems on my own. Which is honestly really exciting. I think another thing that was particularly dfficult was the fact that I knew what I needed to code to do but I didn't really know how to put that in code if that makes sense, but I did figure it out it just took a little bit of time.

2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You can use the preset questions and match the specific information that people may put in to the information database to pull the correct answers to the person.
